# Rule-Based-Chatbot-Assistant
The Rule-Based Chatbot Assistant is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to provide automated, structured responses based on predefined rules and conditions. It uses a rule-based system where each user query is matched against a set of rules, and a corresponding response is generated. The system is programmed to recognize specific keywords or patterns in user input, trigger the relevant response, and assist with tasks like answering frequently asked questions, guiding users through processes, or providing information on demand.
